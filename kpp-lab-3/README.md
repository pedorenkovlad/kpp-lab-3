# PomDO_Node
The to do app meets the pomodoro technique to help you achieve more. With this app you can keep track of your tasks and the time you spent on each. If you want to work on a specific task, you have access to a built-in pomodoro timer that will count up (for 25 mins) while you work on your task, and then count downs (for 5) while you rest. 

This is a Full Stack Web App with user registration and authentication included. Screenshots at the bottom.

This is work in progress. I'm planning on adding a few more features.
